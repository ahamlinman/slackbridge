# Problem Statement

What is the one-line statement of the problem this feature solves?

Why is this problem significant? What pain is caused by slackbridge or slackio
missing this feature?

(See the "Explaining Problems" section of https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2 to
learn more about why this section exists.)

# Requirements

What are the essential features of the solution? In other words, if these
things are not present the problem above has not been solved.

# Implementation

Generally speaking, what are the code changes expected to look like?

# User Vision

_Only if this is a slackio feature_

How will this functionality of slackio be exposed through the slackbridge CLI?
That is, how can this internal change be made externally useful?

(Note that this might help provide additional justification for implementation
of a slackio feature.)

# Open Questions

_Optional_

What is still fuzzy about this issue? What snags might be hit during
implementation?
